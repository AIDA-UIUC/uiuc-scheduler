       "4526  ARCH 598     598  Specialized Architectural Practice  This course adds an academic dimension to professionally supervised field experiences in which problems in architectural design and technology are defined, researched, and solved. Advanced doctoral students are introduced to applied research processes in any of architecture's sub-disciplines. Sites of applied research may include commercial firms, not-for-profit organizations, and government agencies. Students work in school-approved firms or agencies of their choice. Written accounts of work accomplished, documentation of research questions developed and pursued, and reflective experiential learning reports must be submitted for evaluation. Field experiences may be part time or full time. 0 graduate hours. No professional credit. Approved for S/U grading only. May be repeated for up to 11 months total of training. This course is intended to facilitate CPT in professionally focused environmental design research for students in the PhD program.

Begins with a study of the origins and sources of this discourse, followed by an examination of evolving orientations from the formative to the post-formative periods. Important controversies generated along the way, including exclusivist-inclusivist, universalist-anti-universalist, and Sufi-anti-Sufi debates, will be explored. This is followed by an assessment of the new approaches to salvation in modern Islamic thought, with particular emphasis on the contemporary pluralist-inclusivist debate.
